Objectives
For the last assignment, I was given task number 7, in which I had to develop an assembly program on the Arduino ATmega 2560 that would allow control of temperature levels in a greenhouse, as well as perform certain functions in specific cases.

My task involved a greenhouse equipped with an air conditioner and a controlled window:
• The objective of the assignment is to maintain temperature within predefined limits.
• The system has a port that defines the maximum values for temperature
• And two sensors that measure internal temperature and external temperature. The sensors are read by analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).
Operation

Control cases:
• If the temperature reaches the maximum value, the window should be opened if the external temperature is lower than the internal temperature.
• Otherwise, the air conditioner should be turned on to cool the environment.
• It should be noted that under normal conditions, the air conditioner operates in heating mode.

Window Operation:
• The operation of the window and the air conditioner is controlled by an output port called PCTRL.
• The most significant bit of PCTRL controls the opening (low level) or closing (high level) of the greenhouse window.

Air Conditioner Operation:
• The second least significant bit activates the air conditioner in heating mode (low level).
• Whereas the least significant bit activates the air conditioner in cooling mode (low level).
