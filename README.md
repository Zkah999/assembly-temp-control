# Temperature control with arduino (assembly)
This is a program for temperature control for a greenhouse with arduino ATmega2560 with the use of assembly language

For the temperature reading's it was used ADC's (ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL-CONVERTER), we didnt get the chance to use temperature sensors

It was a project for the class Microprocessors
